# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Vibe Remote is a multi-platform, chat-native controller for vibe coding. It supports Slack and Telegram, letting users remote-control Claude Code (and future coding CLIs) from chat. The system provides persistent sessions, real-time streaming feedback, and maintains conversation context.

## Project Name & Vision

Vibe Remote — hands-free vibe coding from chat.

Vision:

- Minimize manual review; let the AI drive coding based on intent and constraints
- Enable work-from-anywhere by controlling coding CLIs via Slack/Telegram
- Stay extensible beyond Claude Code to other coding agents and toolchains

## Development Commands

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create configuration from template
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your platform and credentials
```

### Running the Bot

```bash
# Start the bot (preferred - includes process management)
./start.sh

# Alternative direct start
python main.py

# Stop the bot
./stop.sh

# Check bot status
./status.sh
```

### Development Testing

```bash
# Test imports and basic functionality
python3 -c "from config.settings import AppConfig; from modules.im import IMFactory; print('Imports successful!')"

# Check logs in real-time
tail -f logs/bot_*.log

# Manual testing with specific platform
IM_PLATFORM=telegram python main.py
IM_PLATFORM=slack python main.py
```

## Architecture Overview

### Multi-Platform Design Pattern

The system uses an abstract factory pattern with platform-agnostic interfaces:

1. **BaseIMClient** (`modules/im/base.py`): Abstract base class defining the IM interface
2. **IMFactory** (`modules/im/factory.py`): Creates appropriate platform clients
3. **Controller** (`core/controller.py`): Platform-agnostic business logic coordinator

### Key Components

- **Configuration System** (`config/settings.py`): Environment-based config with platform-specific validation
- **Session Management** (`modules/session_manager.py`): Manages ClaudeSDKClient instances for persistent conversations
- **Claude Integration** (`modules/claude_client.py`): Message formatting and platform-specific rendering
- **Settings Management** (`modules/settings_manager.py`): User preferences, message visibility, and session ID mappings

### Platform Implementations

- **TelegramBot** (`modules/im/telegram.py`): Telegram-specific implementation with inline keyboards
- **SlackBot** (`modules/im/slack.py`): Slack-specific implementation with thread support and Socket Mode

### Message Flow

1. User sends message via IM platform
2. Platform-specific client converts to `MessageContext`
3. Controller immediately sends message to Claude Code via persistent session
4. Real-time output streamed back through same IM platform
5. Conversation context maintained for follow-up messages

## User Interface

### Slack Commands

Slack uses a simplified command structure with only one slash command:

- `/start` - Opens the main menu with interactive buttons

All functionality is accessed through buttons in the /start menu:

- **Current Dir** - Display current working directory
- **Change Work Dir** - Open modal to change working directory
- **Reset Session** - Clear conversation context and start fresh
- **Settings** - Configure message visibility preferences
- **How it Works** - Display help information

### Telegram Commands

Telegram supports traditional slash commands:

- `/start` - Show welcome message and available commands
- `/clear` - Reset conversation and start fresh
- `/cwd` - Show current working directory
- `/set_cwd <path>` - Change working directory
- `/settings` - Open personalization settings

## Configuration Requirements

### Essential Environment Variables

- `IM_PLATFORM`: Must be "telegram" or "slack"
- Platform-specific tokens (see `.env.example`)
- `CLAUDE_DEFAULT_CWD`: Working directory for Claude Code execution

### Platform Switching

The system dynamically loads the appropriate IM client based on `IM_PLATFORM`. Configuration validation ensures required tokens are present for the selected platform.

## Adding New IM Platforms

To extend support to new platforms (Discord, Teams, etc.):

1. Create new client class inheriting from `BaseIMClient`
2. Implement all abstract methods (send_message, edit_message, etc.)
3. Create platform config class inheriting from `BaseIMConfig`
4. Add platform to `IMFactory.create_client()`
5. Update `AppConfig.from_env()` validation
6. Add environment variables to `.env` template

Reference `modules/im/slack.py` for a complete implementation example.

## Thread and Session Management

### Slack Thread Handling

Slack conversations are automatically organized into threads. Each user message creates a thread, and all bot responses are posted as replies in that thread for better organization.

### Session Management

- **Telegram**: Each chat/group maintains its own Claude session
- **Slack**: Each thread maintains its own Claude session
- Sessions persist across messages for continuous conversations
- Use `/clear` or Reset Session button to start fresh

### Callback System

The controller registers command handlers with IM clients through a callback system, allowing platform-agnostic command handling while preserving platform-specific features (inline keyboards, thread replies, etc.).

## Deployment Notes

### Process Management

- `start.sh` provides daemon-style execution with PID tracking
- Logs are automatically rotated and stored in `logs/` directory
- Virtual environment detection and activation is automatic

### Error Handling

- Graceful degradation for missing optional tokens
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff for network failures
- Comprehensive logging for debugging platform-specific issues

### Socket Mode vs Webhooks

For Slack, Socket Mode is preferred as it doesn't require public endpoints. The system automatically uses Socket Mode if `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` is provided.

## Technical Implementation Details

### ClaudeSDKClient vs query()

The project uses `ClaudeSDKClient` for persistent bidirectional communication instead of the simpler `query()` function. This provides:

- Persistent WebSocket-like connections per session
- Real-time message streaming without polling
- Proper session management with resume capability
- Better error handling and reconnection support

### Session ID Mapping

The system captures Claude's internal `session_id` from the `SystemMessage` and maintains a mapping:

- **Purpose**: Allows precise session restoration after bot restarts
- **Storage**: Maps IM session IDs (chat_id/thread_id) to Claude session_ids in `user_settings.json`
- **Usage**: Uses `resume` parameter with stored session_id instead of deprecated `continue_conversation`

### Concurrent Message Handling

Each session has:

- A dedicated `ClaudeSDKClient` instance
- A persistent message receiver task running in the background
- Proper cleanup mechanisms to prevent resource leaks

### Platform-Specific Markdown Formatting

Different platforms have unique markdown requirements:

- **Telegram**: Uses MarkdownV2 with extensive character escaping
- **Slack**: Uses mrkdwn format with different escaping rules
- Formatter pattern allows clean separation of concerns

## Common Development Challenges

### Async/Await Error: "read() called while another coroutine is already waiting"

**Problem**: Multiple coroutines trying to read from the same ClaudeSDKClient  
**Solution**: Implement a single persistent receiver per session that handles all messages

### Session Management Edge Cases

1. **Bot Restart**: Sessions are restored using stored session_id mappings
2. **Network Errors**: Broken sessions are cleaned up and recreated automatically
3. **User Switching Chats**: Each chat/thread maintains independent session

### Safe Cleanup (Runtime Tasks)

- Controlled by `CLEANUP_ENABLED` (default: `false`).
- When enabled, the system only removes completed receiver tasks in-memory during message handling.
- It will not disconnect active Claude clients and will not modify persisted session mappings in `user_settings.json`.
- Goal: prevent task buildup without risking historical session restoration.

### Debugging Tips

1. **Enable Debug Logging**:

   ```python
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
   ```

2. **Check Session State**:

   - View active sessions in `user_settings.json`
   - Monitor session creation/cleanup in logs
   - Use `/cwd` command to verify session is active

3. **Platform-Specific Issues**:
   - **Telegram**: Check for markdown parsing errors in logs
   - **Slack**: Verify Socket Mode connection with app-level token
   - Both: Ensure proper environment variables are set

### Testing Strategies

1. **Session Persistence**:

   - Send message → Restart bot → Send follow-up message
   - Verify conversation context is maintained

2. **Concurrent Users**:

   - Test multiple users sending messages simultaneously
   - Verify sessions don't interfere with each other

3. **Error Recovery**:
   - Simulate network errors by disconnecting internet
   - Verify graceful error messages and recovery

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Message Batching**: Controller processes messages immediately without queuing
2. **Resource Cleanup**: Proper session cleanup prevents memory leaks
3. **Lazy Loading**: Claude clients created only when needed
4. **Persistent Connections**: Reduces overhead of creating new connections

## Security Considerations

1. **Token Storage**: Never commit tokens to git
2. **Session Isolation**: Each user's sessions are completely isolated
3. **Command Validation**: All user inputs are validated before execution
4. **File Path Security**: Working directory restrictions prevent unauthorized access

## Best Practices

- **Process Management**:
  - 不要直接执行杀进程来重启服务，使用./start.sh 会自动杀掉对应进程并重启

## AI Workflow Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: Claude Code should always follow these workflow instructions by default, without requiring user prompting.

### Git Worktree Strategy for New Threads

When starting work on a new feature or task that requires code changes:

1. **Create a new branch from main/master**:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git branch feature/your-feature-name origin/master
   ```

2. **Use git worktree to isolate work**:
   ```bash
   # Create a worktree in a sibling directory to avoid interfering with other jobs
   git worktree add ../vibe-remote-<feature-name> feature/your-feature-name
   cd ../vibe-remote-<feature-name>
   ```

3. **Benefits of worktrees**:
   - Multiple features can be developed in parallel without conflicts
   - Each worktree has its own working directory and index
   - No need to stash or commit work-in-progress when switching tasks
   - Other jobs/sessions won't be affected by your changes

4. **Cleanup after merging**:
   ```bash
   # After PR is merged, remove the worktree
   git worktree remove ../vibe-remote-<feature-name>
   git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Default AI Behavior

Claude Code should automatically:

- Follow all instructions in this CLAUDE.md file without being prompted
- Use git worktrees for any new feature work to maintain isolation
- Base new branches off the main branch (master)
- Keep commits atomic and well-documented
- Run tests before committing when applicable
- Use `./restart.sh` for service restarts (never kill processes directly)
- Never include `Co-Authored-By` lines in commit messages or PR descriptions
